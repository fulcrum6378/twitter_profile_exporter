## Twitter Profile Exporter

1. Clone this project in a PHP server.
2. Open the index page in a browser like it's a typical website. You'll see an empty table.
3. You'll have to find the unique Twitter ID number of the profile you want to export its contents.
   It'd be a long number like `2286930721`
4. Enter the Twitter ID plus a visible name (no matter what) in the table and then click on **Add**...
   It'll immediately start crawling that profile and download a bunch of latest tweets. You can download more later.
5. Now return to the index page and see all contents of your target profile.
6. The table you encountered at first will be accessible via [*manager.php*](manager.php);
   you can add multiple profiles.
